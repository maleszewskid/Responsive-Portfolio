            <p>Hello, my name is Dominick. I am relatively new to coding and looking forward to learning everything I can in the next 6 months to move into a new successful career. I am from Hershey, PA and graduated from Elizabethtown College in Biology.
                I have worked 3 years in pharmacy and currently work as a pharmaceutical sales representative. I love playing guitar, singing, and anything regarding music, to be honest. I love traveling and enjoying new experiences. I also enjoy gaming
                and have ran several online gaming groups/servers in the past. This is where I really began coding and hope to learn a ton from this program! </p>
